# Crowdfunding-ETL
Module 8
## Summary
The purpose of this analysis was to perform ETL and data analysis on a new dataset that contains backer information who have pledged to live projects.  Independent Funding requested some new tables made from the backers email information and what was left of the goal for the live projects.  They also requested a table from the contacts information with the remaining goal amount.
